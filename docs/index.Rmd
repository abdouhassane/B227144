In this assessment, I will be looking at heart medication prescriptions in Scotland, specifically statins. There are 5 major statins prescribed in the NHS: atorvastatin,fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin. Statins are effective medications for lowering the risk of heart disease or stroke as they reduce build up of LDL cholesterol, the bad kind, which can lead to artery narrowing and blockages. If left to accumulate, this could lead to a heart attack or stroke.

In the first section I will look at statins prescribed in each health board, viewing the most prescribed and the associated costs. I will be focusing on January 2024 data.

```
From figure 1, Atorvastatin is the highest prescribed statin in all healthboards with NHS Orkney at a value of 3.44. It should be highlighted that Orkney does have a small population, 22,000, which is why it is larger than say NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with a population of 1,193,420. The lowest is fluvastatin in NHS Lanarkshire 0.0016 and this seems to be trend in other healthboards. Figure 1 also highlights that statin prescriptions are dominated by Atorvastatin, Simvastatin and Rosvastatin.
